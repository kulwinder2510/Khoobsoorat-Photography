        <p>Today, many people today like learning about photography online, which is a great way to search through large amounts of information (and carry a reference in your pocket).

            After operating Photography Life for more than a decade, we decided it was time to fill this gap for beginning photographers. As we see it, people should be able to start learning photography with little to no prior knowledge, dig down for a bit, and emerge with a solid understanding of the most important concepts.
